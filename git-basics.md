# Git Basics

```
git clone https://github.com/arntzy/cli-music-2019
```

Each week, create a new branch with {your_name}/week-{week_number} 

```
git checkout -b aaron/week-01
```


When ever you are going to make changes, pull from master first to avoid merge conflicts

```
git pull origin master
```
