# Week 4
- Lisps and FP (Functional Programming)
- Intro to Overtone / Clojure
- Intro to Tidal-Cycles / Haskell
- Live-Coding and Midi Interaction

#### Assignment #4 (Due week 5)
- Get TidalCycles and Overtone running locally on your machine
- set up a 3-minute piece to play for the class (either recorded or live) 
- Be prepared to have an rpi3 or rpi4 for next week
