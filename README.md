# Music From The Command Line

In this class students will learn to use text-based music/sound frameworks and the command line to produce original compositions. We will survey different computer music tools to find commonality and idiosyncrasies in computer music systems. In addition to generating recorded music, students will also perform in a live-coding environment -- all in the terminal.  

The class will conclude with a public performance of your final projects: **TBD at ITP**

## Grading
* Each of the projects, as well as class participation, is worth an equal amount of your grade, 
* To turn in your projects, add them to the [class wiki](https://github.com/arntzy/cli-music-2019/wiki). (Just hit the edit button)
* Please come to class, and be on time!
* Coming to class more than 20 minutes late counts as an absence.
* More than one unexcused absence is grounds for failure :(
* But no one will fail.

## Expectations and general notes
* We will be critiquing each others work in the class. Be honest but friendly when critiquing other students. When receiving critique please listen and take feedback seriously.
* Feel free to use your laptop in class to take notes or follow along when I'm covering programming topics. Please do not use your laptops to do stuff on social media unrelated to the class etc.
* The only time laptop use is strictly prohibited is when other students are presenting their work.
* Turn off your phones or put them on silent during class

## Office Hours and General Help

I'm available to meet by appointment in person or by Skype/Google Hangouts. Please email me at aja466@nyu.edu to schedule a meeting, or if you have any questions or concerns about the class.
