# ITP/IMA Course Proposal

This is for proposing classes at ITP/IMA in New York.  We need this by Oct 1 for
Spring classes and by March 1 for Fall classes.

Most classes are  4 points typically 14 weeks.  We also run 2 point classes that
meet over 7 weeks and occasionally 1pt  classes.  Grad classes typically meet
once a week for 2.5-3 hours. Undergraduate classes typically meet twice a week
for 1.5 hours.

## Course Title
Music From The Command Line

## Course Description
How do different text-based computer frameworks define sound and music?
This fast-paced course aims to leverage the power of existing command line and
text tools to create expressive computer music compositions with code. Many
programming languages will be used and no GUIs will harmed in
the making of these compositions.

## What will students do?
Students will learn to use text-based music/sound frameworks and the command
line to produce original compositions. We will survey different computer music
tools to find commonality and idiosyncrasies in computer music systems. In
addition to generating recorded music, students will also perform in a
live-coding environment. The class will end with a performance at ITP.

## How will the course be structured? How Many Weeks?
This will be a 7-week survey course focusing on one or two different
systems/tools/frameworks each week. Students will be expected to generate a
project each week in the system/tool/framework of the week. WIP Syllabus can be
found [here](link to syllabus) 

## Who will teach it?
Aaron Arntz

## Is this for Graduate (ITP) or Undergraduate (IMA) or both?
ITP, but.... maybe IMA? It might be too difficult for inexperienced
programmers.

## How Do You Know About ITP/IMA/Tisch/NYU?
I am a very grateful ITP graduate from the class of 2015.
